Stove core:
You need to put this face a small room and the storage size is the size of room(attention: Don't use tow or more core to face same room, And the target room should placed full roof), and then raise the room to 1600 degrees. The core temperature will follow, but at a slower rate (it takes about a day to get to 1600 degree centigrade). At 1600 degree centigrade you can do almost anything like casting, smelting things, destroying things.

It is made for the stove system and the default temperature is 1650 degrees. There are 4 types of  heaters in total. You can find them in the temperature column.It can also blocked like a wall.
