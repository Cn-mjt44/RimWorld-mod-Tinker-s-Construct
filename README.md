## Description:

- **Stove core:**
- You need to put this face a small room and the storage size is the size of room(attention: Don't use tow or more core to face same room, And the target room should placed full roof), and then raise the room to 1600 degrees. The core temperature will follow, but at a slower rate (it takes about a day to get to 1600 degree centigrade). At 1600 degree centigrade you can do almost anything like casting, smelting things, destroying things.

- **Inputer:**
- With the use of Inputer hopper, especially pay attention to the placing direction of the hopper must follow the instructions, otherwise it will not work.
The Input requirements:
Raw materials allowed       : unconditional
Smeltable weapon            : core temperature 1600 ° c (material)
Allowed raw materials       : core temperature 1600 ° c (material)
Steel slag block            : core temperature 1400 ° c (steel)
Stone                       : core temperature 1600 ° c (stone brick)
No Allowed raw materials : core temperature: 1600 ° c (destroyed)
Items allowed: meltable weapons, clothing, metal, stone bricks, chunk, weapons part, assembled weapons.
And,it should be put on the wall, target room should placeed full roof.

- **Outputer:**
- When there is a cooling bucket or Casting Table in the outlet of the Outputer, and the core temperature above 1600 ° c, and the selected material meets the requirements of the target container, it can be output.And,it should be put on the wall,target room should placeed full roof.

- **Cooling bucket:**
- When nothing is put on the cooling bucket and the material will input by the Outputer, it can be cooled if there is material in the Cooling bucket. The final cooling product is raw material.

- **Casting Table:**
- When nothing is put on the casting table and a mold is installed, and the core has enough material for casting, the corresponding Item in the mold can be cast. The amount of material is based on the material requirements of the Item in  the mold.

- **Wall heater:**
- The wall heater is extremely fast and can heat the room to high temperature (there has only one type can control the target temperature). It is made for the stove system and the default temperature is 1650 degrees. There are 4 types of  heaters in total. You can find them in the temperature column.It can also blocked like a wall.

- **Mold:**
- The mold can shape up for the product on the carving table, and the product should made of one kind of material. The amount of material that is required for the composition of the product.

- **Assemble weapon/tool:**
- You can assemble them in batches on the Machine Table, but you can't decide which part to use. Of course, you can also right click on the Machine Table and click "start assembling weapons" to customize the assemble weapons. And, I also left a way to disassembling the assemble weapons for the machining table. All the properties of the assembled weapon depend on the part that assembled it.

- **Replace the parts of the assembled weapon/tool:**
- You can customize the assembly weapon by right-clicking on the Machine Table and clicking on “start assembling weapons”. Then click on the rightmost box to select the weapon you want to replace the part, and then select the parts you want to replace in the left box.

- **Weapon/tool part:**
- Part affect the way the Assemble weapon/tool by material, quality, and a special offset multiplier set by the part author (you can make your own extensions). I have not use up all the function just now.And I will make more part to use up all the function.
